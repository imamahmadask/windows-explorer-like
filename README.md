- `ExplorerUI.vue`: Main component for the explorer interface
- `FolderTree.vue`: Component for rendering the folder tree structure

## Configuration

The application expects a backend API to be available for fetching folder data. Update the `API_BASE_URL` in `src/components/ExplorerUI.vue` to point to your backend server:

```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://your-backend-url/api'
```
